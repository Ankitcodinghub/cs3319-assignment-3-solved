Purpose

Upon completion of assignment 3 you will be able to:

Write a program using PHP and mysql that connects to a backend database

Allow a user to make updates, insertions, deletions and query a database

Create a program that runs on the internet

Create a Graphical User Interface using HTML and CSS

Instructions

MAKE SURE YOU PUT ALL YOUR CODE IN A SUBFOLDER OF /var/www/html called√Ç a3yourmiddlename√Ç (e.g. mine would be a3kathryn) AND MAKE SURE YOU SET THE PERMISSIONS AS FOLLOWS ON YOUR cs3319.gaul.csd.uwo.ca SITE:

cd ~ cd /var/www/html mkdir a3yourmiddlename chmod 755√Ç a3yourmiddlename

We are making the name√Ç a3yourmiddlename√Ç so that the name of your folder is unique and people can‚Äôt see your code without you explicitly giving them the URL,√Ç I.E. so√Ç that the other students in the course can‚Äôt find your folder and copy your html. They can‚Äôt copy your php because it is hidden but they could copy your interface (your html, css and javascript files) so if you make the folder called a3yourmiddlename, it is hard for any student to guess that. If you do NOT have a middlename just pick a first name you wished your parents had given you üôÇ !

Put all your code in√Ç a3yourmiddlename√Ç folder and subfolders of√Ç a3yourmiddlename. Your URL will then be: http://cs3319.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/vm???/a3yourmiddlename

Make sure all your files in the a3yourmiddlename√Ç directory have a permission of 644 (to do this, inside your a3yourmiddlename√Ç folder do this command): chmod 644√Ç filename.php chmod 755√Ç anysubdirectoriesthatyoumakeina3middlenamefolder

Using the database you created for assignment 2,CSS, HTML, PHP and MySQL (and JavaScript if you want, but you don‚Äôt have to use

JavaScript. It is possible to do the whole assignment without using JavaScript), create a website√Ç that allows someone to update the Bus Trip,

Booking, Passenger, Passport and Bus√Ç tables.√Ç Here are the tasks a user must be able to complete

List all the Bus Trip√Ç Data.√Ç Allow the user to order the courses by Trip Name√Ç OR by Country√Ç (you might want to use a radio button for this choice).√Ç For each of these 2 fields (name or country)√Ç √Ç allow the user to either order them in ascending or descending order (you could also use a radio button for this choice).√Ç

You do not need to allow them to change the bus (you can if you want but it is not required for this section, just for the add new trip section) Allow the user to select one of the trips listed and delete that trip. If the trip has any bookings, make sure you let the user know that that trip cannot be deleted. Any permanent deletions should always allow the user the chance to back out.√Ç

Allow the user to create a booking for a trip. The user should be able to pick an existing passenger and an existing trip and then enter the price for that trip.

List all the info about the passengers including passport information in order by last name. Select a passenger and see all of his/her bookings. Allow the user to delete a booking.

List all the bus trips that don‚Äôt any bookings yet.√Ç

It is a good habit to disconnect from a database once you have finished using it, make sure you program disconnects from the database.√Ç

Remember that PHP can get large and cluttered, your application will be marked partly on your structure, comments and modularity, don‚Äôt put everything in one file, try using PHP√Ç includes√Ç and functions and√Ç separate files√Ç to break up the PHP code. Also put comments in your code (but dont include your name, just put something like : Programmer Name: ??√Ç (where ?? is the last 2 digits of your western student number)

NOTE: you√Ç cannot√Ç use any third party DAL frameworks that let you avoid writing SQL queries/statements. We want you get experience writing SQL with this assignment.

Handing in your assignment:

You are required to submit the following via Owl:

In the kritik.io attach/upload: all files (.php and .html and .js and .css and extra files ) used to create your application.√Ç Please zip them together and just upload the .zip file.√Ç √Ç

Late Policy:

5% off for each day late.√Ç You can be up to THREE days late.√Ç

GRADING IN KRITIK

Once the last day to hand in has passed you will be sent an email from kritik.io with 5 or 6 students whose code you must mark. You will get 3 days to do your peer marking. Then you will have 1 day to evaluate the feedback you were given.
